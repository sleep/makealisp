# [Make-a-Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) implementation in C

Goals:
- Write a Lisp interpreter in C from scratch
- Get it to self-host
- *Future?* Port it to an embedded system? Compile for WebAssembly?

Constraints:
- C standard library
- *Future?* No standard library. Aka roll your own malloc, free, strings.h

I'd say implementing a self-hosting lisp interpreter has got to be one of the most cost-effective pedagogical CS exercises. By cost-effective, I mean personal gratification gained and knowledge aquired, over time/energy/motivational complexity spent into a project.
